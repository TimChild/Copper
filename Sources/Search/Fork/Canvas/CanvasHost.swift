// The canvas page in a tab, and the bridge between it and Copper.
//
// A canvas tab is an ordinary Tab whose address is `copper://canvas/<id>`.
// There is no scheme handler: on its way into WebKit that address is caught
// (`decide`, from the browser's navigation delegate) and the bundled
// `canvas.html` is loaded in its place with `loadFileURL`. The tab keeps the
// copper:// address (Tab ignores the file URL), so the omnibox, the session
// and the agents all see the canvas, not a file.
//
// The page speaks through one script message handler, `canvas`
// (`window.webkit.messageHandlers.canvas.postMessage(json)`), and is spoken
// to through `window.copperCanvas.*` (docs/canvas.md has the whole contract).
// It never touches the network: when the canvas has a room on the cloud,
// Copper holds the WebSocket (`CanvasRoom`) and relays frames both ways.
// Every Yjs update the page reports is kept on disk (CanvasStore) before
// anything else happens to it, and so is every update the room hands the
// page (`deliver`), so a canvas works — and survives — offline, including
// what collaborators wrote up to the moment the connection went.
