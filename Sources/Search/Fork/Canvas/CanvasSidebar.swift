//
// - Its menu (TabMenu's first items, so the sidebar row, a favourite and the
//   top bar all have them): Rename Canvas… — a field on the row, as a
//   folder's Rename… is, or a sheet where there is no row — and Delete
//   Canvas… (Leave Canvas… on a shared canvas somebody else owns), a sheet
//   that says what happens first. Then Copper's ordinary tab items.
// - Renaming and deleting go through the Canvas registry (Canvases.rename,
//   .delete, .leave), so a shared canvas changes on the cloud for everyone,
//   every tab holding it follows (CanvasHost.renamed / .removed), and the
//   door's list says the same thing. Personal is neither renamed nor deleted.
