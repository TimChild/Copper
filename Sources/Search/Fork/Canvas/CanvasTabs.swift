// Canvas tabs: how a board is made, opened and kept, wherever Copper offers
// one. A canvas tab is an ordinary Tab at `copper://canvas/<id>` built from
// CanvasHost's configuration (the `canvas` handler is on it before the view
// exists). Everything else a tab does — the row, sleep and wake, session
// restore, split view, moving between spaces — it does as any tab, because
// it is one. What this file adds:
//
// - The ways in. ⌘K and ⌘T (New Canvas, Open Canvas · <name>), File › New
//   Canvas ⌃⇧E, the New Tab row's right-click, the foot plus's right-click,
//   a space's New Canvas in Space, and the Canvas door at the foot. Each new
//   one from these is a local canvas called "Untitled canvas" (the door's
//   New is the way to a shared one); every one of them ends in `show`.
// - One tab per board. `show` goes to the tab already holding a canvas — in
//   this row, another window, or a space no window is showing — before it
//   makes one; `already` (Browser.open) and `reroute` (Tab.go) send every
//   other way of opening one there too.
// - Its place. A canvas's tab, the first time it loads, joins its space's
//   Saved block at the bottom and is selected; Today's sweep passes over it
//   even if somebody drags it down into Today (Sections.sweep).
// - Its face. The row wears the Canvas mark (CanvasPage.icon) where a site
//   wears its icon, its title is the canvas's name (a sleeping or restored
//   row says the registry's name), and the address pill says "Canvas · <name>".
// - What it shows. A canvas tab shows its own board and nothing else: an
//   address typed into its field opens in a tab of its own beside it.
