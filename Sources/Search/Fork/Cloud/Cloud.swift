// Copper Cloud: one self-hosted copper-cloud instance this browser is linked
// to, the account signed in on it, and the one authenticated, certificate-
// pinned HTTP client everything Cloud-shaped talks through — the sync engine
// (CloudSync.swift), the canvas host (Fork/Canvas/) and the settings page.
//
// Nothing here runs on its own. A link is made by pasting a link code, an
// account by signing in — or both at once with a pairing code another
// signed-in Copper made (CloudPairing.swift); until then no request leaves
// the Mac. What is kept
// lives in `cloud.json` beside the session, mode 0600 like agent.json: the
// instance address, its key and certificate fingerprint, the account, the
// session token and the sync switches. The token is never published, never
// logged and never handed to a page. See docs/cloud.md.
