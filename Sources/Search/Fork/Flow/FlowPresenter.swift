/// The one owner of the Move-in sheet.

/// The sheet was a SwiftUI `.sheet` on the page area (`SplitStage`), which
/// exists once per window and is rebuilt whenever a window's page goes away
/// (a tab taken by another window, the last tab closed). So with two windows
/// two sheets came up for one click, and any rebuild dismissed the sheet and
/// presented it again mid-move — the cycling, with two states drawn over each
/// other while one sheet faded out and the next faded in. Here the sheet is
/// an AppKit sheet on one window, begun when `Flow.open` turns on and ended
/// when it turns off, and nothing else can present or dismiss it. It keeps
/// one size while it is up (only a resize of its window changes it), so a
/// change of phase never moves or re-centres it.
