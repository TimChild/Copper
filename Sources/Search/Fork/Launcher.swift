// ⌘T, the way Arc has it.
//
// Upstream's ⌘T makes a blank tab and puts the cursor in its field, so every
// ⌘T you regret is a tab you have to close again. Arc's asks first: the same
// card as ⌘K, a question, and a handful of answers in groups — search for it,
// what Google thinks you are typing, the tab you already have open, the page
// you were on last week — and no tab exists until you pick one. Escape and
// you are exactly where you were.
//
// The card is CommandPalette's; this decides what goes in it and what picking
// a row does. Browser keeps the flat list of rows (so the arrow keys, Return
// and the pointer work the way they already do) and asks here for it on every
// keystroke. The two slow sources — Google's completions and a ranking of all
// of history — are worked out away from the keystroke and handed back through
// `Browser.relaunch` when they land.
