// Links from other apps, landed where the person is looking.
//
// Three things stood between a click in Slack (or Mail, or a terminal's
// `open https://…`) and a page in Copper:
//
// 1. LaunchServices hands a URL to *a* running Copper — it resolves the
//    default browser to a bundle id, then picks one process of that bundle.
//    With an agent's probe alive (a headless run, a test world — launched
//    from the installed bundle, so the same id) that is often the probe,
//    which was there first. The probe opened the page in a world nobody can
//    see; Copper came forward with nothing new in it. `Instance` already
//    corrects the same misroute for a Dock click (`reopenFromProbe`); links
//    get the same treatment: a probe hands the address to the main world's
//    process by pid — an Apple Event aimed at one process, never at a bundle
//    id LaunchServices would resolve all over again — launching that world
//    first when nothing holds its lock.
//
// 2. Links always landed in the first window. With a ⌘N window in front the
//    page opened behind it. Now a link lands in the window in front — or the
//    first one still on screen, one in the Dock, or the first window brought
//    back from closed. (The first window's key observer also outlives its
//    red button now — Fork/Windows.swift — so "in front" stays true after
//    it is closed and brought back.)
//
// 3. A file opened with Copper — an .html, or the .webloc Safari writes when
//    a link is dragged to the Desktop; the bundle has claimed both since the
//    start — was turned away for not being http, so Finder activated Copper
//    and nothing happened. A .webloc (or Windows' .url) is read for the
//    address inside it; a page file opens as itself.
