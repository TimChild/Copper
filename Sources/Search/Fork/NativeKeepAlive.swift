// An extension's worker stays up while it talks to a native host — Chrome's
// rule since Chrome 105: a port from `runtime.connectNative` keeps the
// service worker alive for as long as it is open.
//
// WebKit's rule is different. Thirty seconds after the last event it unloads
// the background unless the background itself posted on an open port in the
// last two minutes; what the host sends doesn't count, nor does a request
// the worker is still working on. So 1Password, holding its port to the
// desktop app (or waiting on it while the person answers 1Password's "Allow
// this browser?"), lost the worker, the port and the host process mid-way,
// and started over on the next event — into a core not yet initialised
// ("WASM is not initialized" from the toolbar icon's update).
//
// While a host is connected, the unload is put off: WebKit's own
// `loadBackgroundContent` reschedules it, and does nothing more when the
// background is up. A host whose worker is gone anyway — WebKit didn't say
// the port closed — is stopped instead of keeping it alive by itself.
