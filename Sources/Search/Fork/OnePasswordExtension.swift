// The 1Password browser extension's two ways in, made reachable in Copper.
//
// 1. Signing the extension in by itself (email, Secret Key, password). Its
//    own Start setup → Sign in opens https://my.1password.com/signin?auth-only=1;
//    the web app there hands the account to the extension's content script
//    (a `B5SignInSucceeded` DOM event → runtime.sendMessage
//    "sign-in-succeeded"), and the extension's worker signs in with it and
//    unlocks itself from then on with the account password. That works in
//    Copper (docs/fixtures/onepassword-e2e.sh drives it as far as 1Password's
//    servers without an account); this file only gives it a button.
//
// 2. The desktop app (Touch ID). 1Password's BrowserSupport host checks the
//    browser that started it: one it knows by signature connects at once;
//    any other signed app in /Applications is held while it waits for a
//    "partner browser authorization" from the extension (BrowserSupport's
//    log: "waiting for potential partner browser authorization from B5X").
//    The extension asks for that only from its welcome page, and only for
//    the browsers in its own list — Copper isn't one, so it never asked and
//    the extension never connected. Its own message for it is
//    "authorize-browser"; sent from one of the extension's pages, BrowserSupport
//    asks the 1Password app, which shows its own Allow prompt and remembers
//    the answer (1Password › Settings › Browser). An ad-hoc-signed build
//    (./build.sh without a certificate) is refused before that: "parent
//    browser was not valid".
