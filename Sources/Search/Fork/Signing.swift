// Who Copper is, to macOS, and what an update has to prove before it may take
// the running app's place. docs/releasing.md has the whole story.
//
// macOS remembers a person's grants — Full Disk Access, Files & Folders,
// Automation — and a keychain item's "Always Allow" against an app's
// designated requirement. Copper's releases used to be signed ad hoc, which
// makes that requirement the hash of one build: every update looked like a
// different app and quietly lost all of them. Releases are now signed with
// one certificate of Copper's own (release/copper-release-signing.cer) and an
// explicit requirement — this identifier, that certificate — that every
// release satisfies, so the grants stay.
//
// Development builds (./build.sh without COPPER_RELEASE=1) are a different
// app altogether: `Fork.devBundle`, signed ad hoc, a test world of their own
// (Store.swift). Nothing they do lands on the installed Copper's grants,
// settings, cookies or keychain identity.
