// opts in from Settings › Labs. One home for all of them, so the next preview
// has a switch to hang from without inventing its own key, page or bench verb.
//
// Each flight is one key under `flights.` in `Store.settings` — a probe
// world's own suite, never the real browser's — read once at launch and
// published, so flipping one re-renders whatever reads it without a restart.
// A flight that is off must cost nothing: no timers, no observers, no files.
