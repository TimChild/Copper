// Trails (a flight — Settings › Labs, docs/trails.md).
//
// Arc made tabs spatial; a trail makes them intentional. A trail is one line
// of intent: it starts where something was typed — a search, an address, a
// link that came in from another app — and grows as pages are opened from
// it. A page opened from a page (⌘-click, target=_blank, window.open) joins
// its opener's trail, under it; anything else starts a trail of its own. The
// column stops being forty rows and becomes a handful of trails.
//
// What this file keeps is lineage and nothing else: for every Today row (a
// loose, unsaved tab), which trail it is in and which page it came from; for
// every trail, its name, the search it began with and when it was last used.
// The rows themselves are still `Browser.tabs` — nothing here moves, closes
// or reorders a tab except the actions a person asks for (Close Trail).
//
// Off, none of it runs: no observers, no timer, no file. On, it watches each
// window's `tabs` and `activeID`, and writes `trails.json` beside the session
// on the same serial-writer pattern as `windows.json`. `session.json` is never
// touched. A tab's id is new every launch, so on disk a page is found again
// by its space, its address and which of that space's same-address rows it
// is — the same things the session restores it from.
