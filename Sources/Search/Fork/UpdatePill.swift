// Arc's update button. When a newer Copper is on its way or ready, a pill
// sits at the foot of the column, just above the space icons, in a strong
// shade of the space's own colour: "Update Copper", a filling bar while it
// downloads, "Restart to Update" once it is verified, "Retry Update" with
// the reason under the pointer when it went wrong. One click does the step
// that is due through `Updates` — download, or swap and relaunch — and it
// goes away by itself once the new Copper is the one running.
//
// It is not a dialog and never takes the keyboard: Copper still "never
// restarts without your say-so" (README › Updates), the click is the say-so.
// Right-click has What's New…, Remind Me Later (until the next launch or the
// next version) and the Settings page.
//
// The column is not always on screen. With the tabs across the top the same
// thing is a short capsule among the toolbar's doors; with the column folded
// away (⌘S) it is a small round badge in the window's bottom-left corner,
// which opens to its label under the pointer.
//
// Everything it says is read off `Updates`; nothing here downloads, checks
// or swaps. The bench can force each state (`updates pill …`) so the pill can
// be looked at without a release to install — a forced pill rehearses its
// clicks instead of making them.
