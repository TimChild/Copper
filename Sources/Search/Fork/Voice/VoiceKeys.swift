// ⌃⇧D, and Escape while dictating — and nothing else, and only where voice
// lives: a browser window whose agent pane is open, with Settings › Voice on.
// Anywhere else the keys go on untouched (with voice off, every key does).
//
// Hold to talk: D down starts, D up — or ⌃ or ⇧ let go — ends. Press to
// start and stop: each D down is one press. The chord's own key events are
// kept from the page and the composer either way, so no "D" is typed, and a
// key held long enough to repeat repeats nothing.
//
// Escape cancels a dictation before anything else hears it: ContentView's
// key handler asks here first (App.swift `take`), and this monitor's own
// look at it covers whichever of the two AppKit calls first.
