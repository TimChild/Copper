# The Move-in sheet comes up once, in one window, at one size, and goes when
# it is told to — whatever door it was opened through, with two windows open,
# and while the page behind it is rebuilt. Counts every open, present,
# dismiss and scan (`bench flow events`) and checks:
#   - two windows => exactly one sheet, hung from the window that asked;
#   - presents == the opens that brought it up, dismisses == closes, never
#     two at once, at most one scan per open;
#   - the sheet's size never changes between phases;
#   - Escape closes it, Return presses the primary button;
#   - taking the page away from under it does not dismiss it;
#   - reopening after a move starts fresh (the picker, not the last summary);
#   - nothing reads another browser's folder at launch;
#   - ⌘Q quits with the sheet up.
