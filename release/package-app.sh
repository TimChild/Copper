#   COPPER_SIGN_IDENTITY=<sha1> [COPPER_SIGN_KEYCHAIN=<path>] \
#     release/package-app.sh <path/to/Copper.app> <version> <out-dir>
#
# Writes to <out-dir>:
#   copper-<version>-macos-arm64.zip          ditto --keepParent archive
#   copper-<version>-macos-arm64.zip.sha256   "<hex>  <zip name>" (shasum format)
# and prints `has_cli=true|false` on stdout (whether the bundle ships the
# `copper` CLI shim at Contents/Resources/bin/copper — the cask renders its
# `binary` stanza only when it does).
#
# Why stamp: Copper's build.sh writes CFBundleShortVersionString from the
# VERSION file (1.0) and CFBundleVersion from the build clock. Homebrew needs a
# monotonic, unique version per release, so the release workflow derives
# <VERSION>.<YYYYMMDD>.<run_number> and this script stamps that same string
# into the bundle so the About box / MCP serverInfo.version match the cask.
# Editing Info.plist invalidates the signature, hence the signing after it.
#
# Why this signature (docs/releasing.md): macOS files a person's grants — Full
# Disk Access, Files & Folders, Automation — and a keychain item's "Always
# Allow" under the app's designated requirement. Ad hoc, that requirement is
# the hash of this one build, so every update dropped them all. Signed with the
# one certificate in release/ and the explicit requirement in
# release/designated-requirement.txt, every release satisfies the same
# requirement and the grants carry over. The identity is that certificate's
# SHA-1, so a secret that holds any other certificate fails here. Flags and
# entitlements are what they were ad hoc: none (no hardened runtime).
#
# Without COPPER_SIGN_IDENTITY the bundle is signed ad hoc, for trying this
# script out; the release workflow refuses to publish such a bundle.
